My attempt to create a small web application allowing you to make basic photo and video editing using your webcam and some predefined images

Setup:

1.) First you will need to have a server running
2.) Go to your browser and paste this link

localhost:8080/camagru/setup.php

This link above will create the database and all the tables so that you may begin using the Web Application
